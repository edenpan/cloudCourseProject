## This is a project for cloud course project

Make use of the deep learning with spark to predict the stock price.

Considering following deeplearning algorithm:
	
	1.Plain Stock Price Prediction via RNNs with Graves LSTM unit.
		reference project: https://github.com/IsaacChanghau/StockPrediction
	2. Since the above project is only a signal node application that using deeplearning 4j library, we need to make use of the offical deeplearning4j with spark to make use of spark.
